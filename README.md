- Fantom & Ethereum mainnet Analytics dashboard (FTM/ETH)

### Introduction

- Here I'm going to share my Data-Alchemist dashboard report, with the most popular chains in the web3.

- My analysis was focused on Ethereum a decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts allow participants to transact with each other without a trusted central authority. Transaction records are immutable, verifiable, and securely distributed across the network, giving participants full ownership and visibility into transaction data. Transactions are sent from and received by user-created Ethereum accounts. A sender must sign transactions and spend Ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, as a cost of processing transactions on the network.

- Second chain on my analysis is Fantom a fast, scalable platform for decentralized applications (dApps) draws its speed from a unique consensus mechanism called Lachesis. Fantom also offers tools that make it easy to integrate existing dApps, a nuanced system of staking rewards, and a suite of built-in decentralized finance (DeFi) tool,

### Description Challenge - using for Reach, Retention, and Revenue analysis to

1. Benchmarking a project against itself over time
2. Benchmarking a project against its peers

### My research analysis was follows: ETH/FTM

1. Reach:

   - Compare the number of transactions count Eth vs FTM
   - Compare the number of active address Eth vs FTM
   - Comparing contract deployed Eth vs FTM

2. Retention:

   - Compare the stickiness ratio Eth vs FTM
   - Comparing new vs existing address Eth vs FTM
   - Comparing cohort retention Eth vs FTM

3. Revenue:
   - Compare token price over time Eth vs FTM
   - Compare total gas spent Eth vs FTM
   - Compare the number gas paid per user Eth vs FTM

#### In this Data-Alchemist I did take into consideration that Ethereum chain is older, establish than Fantom mainnet due to the fact that Fantom is fast, scalable platform for decentralized applications, easy to integrate existing dApps, and a suitable for building decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, which can primary attract more users and developers resulting in mass adoption for Fantom to grow - that what we want to measure here.
